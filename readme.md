#Travel Budgeting App#

What was your motivation?
I would like to build an easy to use expense tracker that's targetted especially for travelling. Why travelling? Because when we travel, we mostly spend cash in converted currency and often it's difficult to keep track of what we spent.

Why did you build this project?
This app also will help you track with the specific's country currency rates.

What problem does it solve?
It has a few roles:

- expense trackers
- it shows live currency rates to avoid being scammed by dodgy currency exchanges.
- nice to have, map API to show currency exchange near you

What did you learn?

What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a "Features" section and listing them here.

Tigana to do:

- research on current budgeting app, what does it look like? maybe some walkthrough of existing code

- reserach on potential front end design. clean minimalist, focussed - tracker and XE rates.

- what features does it need to have? Is it a tracker? budgeting? can I tag certain items in a catagory and add them up? Like monzo.

- can we add up the sum for a potential period? can i add feature to say "how much cash do you have?" what the difference is between whats in tracker and whats in left over cash.
